# You can't share a VPC subnet<a name="tshoot-subnet-limits"></a>

## Scenario<a name="tshoot-subnet-limits-scenario"></a>

When you attempt to use AWS RAM to share a VPC subnet with another account, the sharing operation succeeds\. However, the consuming account shows `LIMIT EXCEEDED` for that resource in the AWS RAM console\.

## Cause<a name="tshoot-subnet-limits-cause"></a>

Some individual resource types have service\-specific limits separate from the limits enforced by AWS RAM\. Some of those limits can effectively prevent sharing even if you haven't reached the one of the limits in AWS RAM\. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) limits the number of subnets that you can share with another individual account\. If you try to share a subnet with a consuming account that already contains the maximum number of subnets, then that consuming accounts displays `LIMIT EXCEEDED` in the console for that resource\. For more information about this limit, see [Amazon VPC Quotas â€“ VPC sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-share-limits) in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*\. 

To address this, first check for other resource shares that might be sharing a subnet with the affected account, and remove those shares that you might no longer require\. You can also request an increase for a limit that supports adjusting\. Use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) to request a limit increase\.
