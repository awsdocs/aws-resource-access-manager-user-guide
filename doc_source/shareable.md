# Shareable AWS resources<a name="shareable"></a><a name="permissions-rbp-supported-resource-types"></a>

AWS RAM lets you share resources that are created and managed by other AWS services\. You can share resources with individual AWS accounts, with the accounts in an organization or organizational units \(OUs\) in AWS Organizations\. Some supported resource types, also let you share resources with individual IAM roles and users\. 

The following sections list the services that work with AWS RAM, and the resources that support sharing\. It also identifies which resource types can be shared with individual IAM users and roles\.
