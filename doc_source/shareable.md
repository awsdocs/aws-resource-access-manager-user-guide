# Shareable AWS resources<a name="shareable"></a>

AWS RAM enables you to share resources that are provisioned and managed in other AWS services\. AWS RAM does not let you manage resources, but it does provide the features that let you make resources available across AWS accounts\.

The following sections list the services that integrate with AWS RAM, and the resources that support sharing\.
